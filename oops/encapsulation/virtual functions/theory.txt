virtual function is the member function defined in the base class and can further be defined in the child class as well.

While calling the derived class, the overridden function will be called.

virtual functions must be member of some class.

virtual functions cannot be static members.

virtual function are accessed through object pointers.

virtual functionmust be defined in the base class, even though it is not used.

The prototype of a virtual function of the base class and all the derived classes must be identical.

If the two functions with the same name but different prototype, c++ will consider them as the overloaded functions.

We cannot have a virtual constructor.
