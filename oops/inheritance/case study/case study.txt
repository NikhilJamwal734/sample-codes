In a university various members belong to the institution such as stuudents and teacher. 
The university keeps track of basic information like name, age and ID for every member.
For students, additional information such as separtment and GPA is maintained, 
while for teachers, the department and subject they teach are tracked.

to maintain this, we can implement a multilevel inheritance system using c++.

    The base class, PERSON will store the basic information common to both students and teacher. 
    The STUDENT class will inherit from PERSON and add specific student related information.
     The GRADUATESTUDENT class will inherit from STUDENT and handle additional details related to graduate-level students.
