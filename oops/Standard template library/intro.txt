the STL is a collection of c++ template classes and functions.
STL provides data structure (containers) and algorithms that facilitate efficient and reusabale code.
It is built on three main components:
    containers
    iterators
    algorithms

Advantages of using STL
    1 code reusability
    2 Performance
    3 Consistency
    4 Extensibility
    5 reduce development time

Components of STL

    containers: store and manage collection of data efficiently.
        eg: vector, list set map.

    Iterators: provide an abstract interface for traversing elemetns in containers.
        eg: begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend().


    algorithms: Perform operatins on containers such as searching sorting and modifying data.
        eg: sort(), find(), transform(),

CONTAINER OVERVIEW

 1 containers are object that store collection of data.
 2 STL containers provide a range of data structure from dynamic arrays to hash tables.
 3 Each container type is designed for speciifc use cases, balancing trade offs between:
        Memory usage
        Insertion , deletion and traversal speed
4 containers are the foundation of STL enabaling efficient data management and manipulation
5 stl provide generic containers that can work with any data type.
6 containers are broadly categorized based on their structure and functionality
        sequence containers
        associative containers
        unordered containers
