Encapsulation intergrates data and the functions that manipulate it, while protecting both from external interference and misuse.

c++ supports the properties of encapsulation and data hiding through the creation of user-defined types, called classes.

Encapsulation involves bundling data together with the function that operate on it, while data abstraction refers to exposing only the necessary interface,
keeping the implementation details hidden from the user.

**** In this we can access private data members from outside the class.
